# 3D Cube
3D cube made from 2D planes. This is meant as a showcase project, not as a real implementation for a 3D library of sorts. It uses the latest Plane element from the CX library, which can be found [here](https://github.com/chalcinxx/CX-Library). I have added a sample CMake file that I used to compile my program with. It is not guaranteed to work on your machine without editing it.
